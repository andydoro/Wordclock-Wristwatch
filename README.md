Forked from the [TIMESQUARE Watch](https://github.com/adafruit/TIMESQUARE-Watch)

This version adds an additional wordclock mode. Requires additional faceplate. Laser cut or 3D print based on the provided vector / model files. 

After downloading, rename folder to 'Watch' and install in Arduino Libraries folder. Restart Arduino IDE, then open File->Sketchbook->Library->Watch->Watch sketch.

This version also adds automatic daylight saving time adjustment for the US and Canada!
